1. Lambdata package works as intended and contains good, informative docstrings and some creative methods. 

2. Methods could use some finetuning, so it becomes easier for others to work with and/or extend on it.

3. Code is well structured and stylistically in order. Perhaps do a spell check to correct any typos. ;-)
